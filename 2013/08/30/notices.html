<h2 id='new_parking_dropoff_and_pickup_information'>New parking, drop-off, and pick-up information</h2>

<p>Parking: To better manage student safety some visitor and staff parking spaces have been switched. These changes have been made only to the side parking lot. As always, staff parking will be indicated with white lines and visitor parking will have yellow lines. The twelve spots that are adjacent to the grass that were formally designated as visitor spots have now been switched to staff parking. These twelve spots have been moved to the Bow Center Road side of the center section of the parking lot.</p>

<p>Drop-Off: If you are planning on any extended conversations with your child at drop-off we ask that you park in one of the new yellow visitor spots. We are hoping that you will have the opportunity to pull through in the spot which should make it easier when you exit. If you are just planning on a quick good-bye we ask that you pull as far forward as possible in the drop-off lane. This will help keep the school traffic off of Bow Center Road.</p>

<p>Pick-Up: Please use the newly painted yellow visitor spots to wait for the students or pull forward in the drop-off lane.</p>

<p>Please drive slowly in the parking lot as many students are moving through the parking lot both at arrival and dismissal times. We appreciate your patience and thank you for your efforts in helping ensure the safety of the students.</p>

<h2 id='first_lego_league'>FIRST Lego League</h2>

<p>An informational meeting will be held on September 4th in the Bow Memorial Technolgy Education room from 8:00 am to 8:20 am. Please click <a href='http://www.bownet.org/bmsadmin/Lego%20L%20Information.docx'>here</a> to see an informational letter about First Lego League.</p>

<h2 id='student_council'>Student Council</h2>

<p>The first Student Council meeting will be held on Tuesday, September 10 at 8:00 in room 33.</p>

<h2 id='homework_requests'>Homework Requests</h2>

<p>Just a reminder to parents, if your child is sick and misses school: As always, please be sure to notify the office (225-3212) that your son/daughter will be absent.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>for 1 day</strong>, please have your child check-in with his/her teachers upon return to school (no need to collect homework while out).</li>

<li><strong>for 2 or more days</strong>, please contact the office at 225-3212 to arrange for homework to be collected if you feel your child will be able to complete work while absent. The homework packet will be available by 3:30pm on the specified pick-up day (please note that the front office closes for the day at 4:30pm, but a custodian will be able to help you after that time).</li>
</ul>

<p>Most importantly, if your child is sick, we strongly encourage rest and recuperation.</p>

<h2 id='arrival_reminder'>Arrival Reminder</h2>

<p>Just a reminder that school grounds are <em>not</em> supervised by school personnel before the start of the school day at 8:30am.</p>

<p><strong>Students should only be arriving earlier if they have made prior arrangements with a teacher and the teacher has issued a pass.</strong> Teachers who have students arrive prior to 8:30am will meet these students in the front lobby.</p>

<p>Students may not ride the elementary bus without a signed pass from a teacher who has made the arrangements.</p>
