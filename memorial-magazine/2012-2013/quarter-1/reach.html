<p>The <strong>BMS Mentoring Program</strong> is underway again this year for students who want to pursue a certain area of study beyond what they are learning in the classroom.  We have students pursuing interests in the areas of creative writing, art, math, science, relaxing activities, and reading.  Through various writing activities, Deborah Mooney, a BHS junior, is sharing her love of creative writing with a group of 5th graders.  Seventh and eighth graders in Art Club are working with mentor Chris O’Brien focusing on drawing and painting. They visited Kimball Jenkins Estate in Concord where the students toured two art galleries and the mansion, visited with two artists in their studios, and had an art lesson using charcoal. Rob Kramer is working with a group of 5th graders on advanced math topics as well as a group of 6th graders on various science topics.  A group of 6th graders is enjoying relaxing activities with BHS senior Lindsey Nerbonne. Jen Leger and Laurie Fischer from the Bow Baker Free Library are mentoring a book club in which the students are reading and discussing <em>The Hobbit</em>.</p>

<p>We are very fortunate to have these talented mentors, and we appreciate all their time, dedication, and expertise. We are always looking for mentors to assist us in the program. Parents, community members, and high school students can be mentors.  If you have a special interest or skill that you would enjoy sharing with one or more of our students, please contact Christy Romano or check out details of the mentoring program at <a href="http://www.bownet.org/gifted">www.bownet.org/gifted</a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html">MIT’s SPLASH 2012</a></em> will be held on November 19 and 20 on the MIT campus in Cambridge, MA.  SPLASH is a weekend long extravaganza of lectures, workshops, and seminars for middle school and high school students. Classes are offered in mathematics, science, philosophy, computer science, literature, hobbies, and many other interesting topics. Courses are taught by MIT students and other local college students and professionals who want to share their interests and specialties with you.  The cost for the program is $40 for students.  For more information visit their <a href="http://esp.mit.edu/learn/Splash/index.html">website</a>.</p>

<p><em><a href="http://www.destinationimagination.org">Destination Imagination</a></em> is an opportunity for students in grades 1 through 8 to use their creativity and work together to solve a “challenge.” Teams of up to seven students will work after school on a solution to one of five different challenges.  These students will be required to make a commitment to their teammates and their “challenge” from November through March.  In March, teams will take their solutions to a regional tournament, where they will meet with other teams, see how others solved the same “challenge,” celebrate their creativity, and have a lot of fun!  Forms are available from Mrs. Romano in REACH.</p>

<p>Information is available to parents and students in grades 5-8 regarding the <em><a href="http://cty.jhu.edu">Johns Hopkins University/Center for Talented Youth (CTY)</a></em> program.  The Johns Hopkins University Talent Search identifies, assesses, and recognizes students with exceptional mathematical and/or reasoning abilities.  Qualified students may take CTY summer courses on college campuses throughout the US or online courses and also participate in the family academic programs (fees associated). More information can be found at <a href="http://cty.jhu.edu">http://cty.jhu.edu</a>.</p>

<p>If you are interested in volunteering for any of these programs or would like more information, please contact Christy Romano at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#099;&#114;&#111;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#111;&#064;&#098;&#111;&#119;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#099;&#114;&#111;&#109;&#097;&#110;&#111;&#064;&#098;&#111;&#119;&#110;&#101;&#116;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>, call 225-3212 ext. 416, or visit the REACH website at <a href="http://www.bownet.org/gifted">www.bownet.org/gifted</a>.</p>
