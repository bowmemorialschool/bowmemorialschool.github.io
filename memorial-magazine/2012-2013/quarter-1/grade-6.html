<h2 id='reading'>Reading</h2>

<p>Sixth grade is off to a great start. In reading class, students began the year with a nonfiction unit that focused on reading comprehension skills as well as some test-taking strategies. Following that the students started a fiction unit and literature circles. To date, students have had two literature circle meetings. In this activity students select their books, their groups, and they decide as a group who is going to assume which literature circle role. After one meeting, students change roles, and they progress through their book. Students are using a wide variety of novels as they complete their literature circles.</p>

<h2 id='language_arts'>Language Arts</h2>

<p>The first quarter in language arts brought many opportunities for writing. In September, students were introduced to free-verse poetry. After discussing the elements of a free verse, students wrote free verses about their own lives. The poems are beautiful; I clearly have many motivated writers! We then moved on to narrative writing. Although this unit included the six traits of writing, the focus was on fluency and word choice. The fluency portion consisted of learning about the three types of sentences, simple, complex, and compound, as well as two types of conjunctions,coordinating and subordinating. The word choice portion consisted of writing sentences that help the reader experience the story. Strategies for writing &#8220;showy&#8221; sentences were discussed and practiced. We are now utilizing the beautiful scenery right outside our classroom to inspire us as we write our autumn poems! As the song goes, &#8220;I love L.A.!&#8221;</p>

<h2 id='math'>Math</h2>

<p>In mathematics classes, students have spent the beginning part of the year building the foundations for a strong math experience. They have reviewed the basics of estimation, computation (with whole numbers and decimals), and solving simple expressions. They also spent a good amount of time strategizing methods to solve word problems and practiced &#8220;explaining or showing&#8221; their thinking. The sixth graders also touched briefly on geometry and fractions. In addition to the daily classroom work, the students have been responsible for keeping up with various skills through the weekly work assignments (20Qs, PS, and fact packets). The students have begun to focus on &#8220;pre-fraction&#8221; skills, including factors and multiples.</p>

<h2 id='science'>Science</h2>

<p>Science students started the year exploring the process of classification. They learned how to use and then make classification keys. Ask the sixth graders how to play &#8220;dichotomous key.&#8221; They then began looking at the qualities of life. Students learned about the five traits of life and about the simplest forms of life, and they learned about plant and animal cells. They began to use virtual microscopes and then started using the compound microscopes. Students learned to make wet-mount slides and looked at simple pond organisms. They are continuing the life science unit by learning about mitosis. Next, the sixth graders will be studying the budding of yeast cells.</p>

<h2 id='social_studies'>Social Studies</h2>

<p>After becoming familiar with the social studies textbook by completing a scavenger hunt activity, the students brainstormed and shared numerous reasons for studying history. The first unit was about geography, including the five themes of location, place, human-environment interaction, regions, and movement. The students learned about absolute and relative location and had fun playing Battleship using latitude and longitude. They learned about the impact of humans on the environment, including information about terracing, desertification, polders, pollution, and deforestation. The students mapped the regions of the classroom and shared sample products manufactured outside of the United States. They applied their understanding of geography by creating a map of an original country, with very creative results! The geography unit was followed by a unit on archaeology, which culminated in an archaeological dig. The study of early man is coming next!</p>
