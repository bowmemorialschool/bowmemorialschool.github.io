<h2 id="social-studies">Social Studies</h2>

<p>In social studies class, we have been studying the development of art, technology, and architecture by the Greeks and Romans. This  will allow us to see how much of the world fell into the Dark Ages, which lead to the Renaissance. The activities we have completed include making Prima Porta statues along with funerary and panathenaic amphorae.</p>

<h2 id="math">Math</h2>

<p>All mathematics classes have spent most of the first quarter studying 2D and 3D figures. They have focused on perimeter, area, surface area, and volume. Students have reviewed the problem-solving steps and strategies and order of operations with whole numbers, decimals and fractions, in preparation for the NECAPs.</p>

<p>Currently, the general math classes are working on an integer unit. For warm-up they must determine the mystery integer based on real-life examples. They are also learning about the operations with integers and absolute value. In the advanced math classes, students are studying rational numbers. Who knew they could be written in so many forms? Well, the students are discovering the number of ways to convert rational numbers and the operations performed on them as well.</p>

<p>Also, if you haven’t noticed already, students will be receiving the 10Q’s and problem-solving challenges biweekly (alternating). These assessments are designed to keep skills taught fresh, reinforced, and retained. It would be greatly appreciated if students were encouraged at home to use their resources to complete the these problems in order to produce quality work.</p>

<h2 id="science">Science</h2>

<p>Ms. Wetterer’s science class has had an exciting start to the 2012-13 school year. To our surprise, we received an unexpected “gift” of a bear’s digestive tract! The tract came from a sow (female) bear who weighed approximately 150 lbs. She was “harvested” by bow and arrow. During classes, we observed the stomach, small and large intestines, liver, gall bladder, pancreas, a kidney, part of the diaphragm, and lots of fatty tissue that had been stored for winter survival.</p>

<p>During the study period at the end of the day, we cut into the organs to see what the various tissues looked like. We also saw the bile inside of the gall bladder and the differences in the food/waste from the small intestine to its passage into the large intestine. Best of all were the stomach contents! One meal was composed of acorns and was the consistency of tan-colored cat litter. There was a distinct line between that and the second meal that was comprised of ground yellow jackets! The yellow jackets were still intact! There were also a few larval forms observed among the many mature yellow jackets.</p>

<p>We are currently attempting to unravel the story behind “The Mystery Pumpkin!” Ask your son or daughter for his or her conclusion!</p>

<p>Students in Mrs. McMillen’s science class have been working on various science basics. They have learned about SI (Standard International Units). Students now know how to convert from American Standard to SI and to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit degrees. Also, students are reviewing the scientific method and will be conducting a major experiment starting next week using the scientific method. Students completed a meniscus lab using graduated cylinders and beakers for measuring liquid. Students will need small, non-flowering plants for the experiment. Information about the plants will be sent home in the next few days.</p>

<h2 id="reading">Reading</h2>

<p>Mrs. McMillen’s reading classes have been very busy the first quarter. Students have been working on analogies, as a lot of you at home already know. Analogies are interesting and can initiate a lot of discussion.  Students have also worked on homonyms. They have been reading short selections and answering questions about recalling details, main idea, sequencing, and drawing conclusions.  Students have also been introduced to new Latin and Greek roots. This will help students determine the meanings of words and also how to spell them using roots. Students should continue reading every day at home for 15 minutes and fill out their time sheets.</p>

<h2 id="language-arts">Language Arts</h2>

<p>The language arts classes with Mrs. McMillen have been working on spelling packets each week. We have spelling packets on four and five-day weeks. Students recently finished their positive and negative graphs.  They will begin writing memoirs using information from their graphs. This will be their narrative writing piece.  Students have also had a refresher on appositives and comparative and superlative forms. We will continue to complete DOL (Daily Oral Language).</p>

<h2 id="other-reading-classes-">Other Reading Classes (?)</h2>

<p>Students in reading class have been introduced to Agatha Christie, mystery novelist. They have become super sleuths, trying to determine who the murderer is in the novel <em>And Then There Were None</em>. In addition, they have learned a great deal of vocabulary along with the novel and have been noticing the differences between life today and life in the 1930’s, the novel’s setting. The classes have also been working on weekly vocabulary lessons and have experienced their first unit test on over forty words!</p>

<h2 id="other-language-arts-classes-">Other Language Arts classes (?)</h2>

<p>In language arts, we recently began working on our first major writing project, which requires students to write a memoir. Students spent a significant amount of time working on graphs that highlight both positive and negative life experiences. From these graphs, students selected one experience to use as a seed idea for their writing. Students have read and discussed sample memoirs and will follow the writing process to write memoirs of their own. As they write, students will apply some of the elements illustrated in each sample discussed in class.</p>

<p>Students have also worked on spelling lessons 1 through 7, participated in many grammar lessons, and completed several DOL (Daily Oral Language) exercises. We will continue with our spelling and DOL routine throughout  the school year.</p>
