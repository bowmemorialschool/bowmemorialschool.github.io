<p>The Guidance Department offers individual and group counseling to students on a regular or as needed basis. The counselors are available to assist and advocate for students. They focus on fostering growth in three areas: personal/social, academic, and career. If a student is having difficulty in school, trouble with friends, or feeling overwhelmed, for example, he/she is welcome to come in and speak with a counselor. Through our classes, Conflict Resolution, DARE, Decision Making, and Transitions, students are able to explore topics such as problem solving, decision making, and goal setting. We welcome parents to call any time with questions or concerns about their child&#8217;s education and well being. Our doors are always open to students who wish to talk. We enjoy getting to know each and every student.</p>

<p>The first months of school have been busy for the Guidance Department. Mrs. Vincent and Mrs. Estefan coordinated the state NECAP testing. Students in grades 5-8 were tested during the month of October in the areas of math and reading. Students in grades 5 and 8 were also tested in the area of writing. Kudos, as always, to all the students for trying their best!</p>

<p>Red Ribbon Week occurred during the week of October 22. Red Ribbon Week promotes awareness of healthy living, making good choices, and prevention of drug and alcohol abuse. Numerous activities took place throughout the week, from Officer Scott&#8217;s trivia at lunch to students pledging to live healthy lifestyles.</p>

<p>The Leaders in Prevention (LIP) program, advised by Mrs. Vincent, Mrs. Ireland, and Mrs. Estefan, is off to a great start. Over 50 students in grades 5-8 have attended the first meetings. This year, students will take part in hosting Red Ribbon Week, Mix-It-Up Day, and Leadership Week. LIP students are working on new activities this year that will be great additions to the program.</p>

<p>The 2012-2013 school year is well underway. We are excited for another wonderful year at BMS!</p>
