<p>The guidance department has been very busy coordinating end-of-the-school-year activities. The fifth grade team worked hard to have a wonderful Move Over Day with the fourth grade students on May 22. The fourth grade students had a wonderful time getting a tour of the building, getting to meet with the fifth grade teachers and specialists, and enjoying lunch and time with their pen pals to ask questions about fifth grade. We also met with the incoming 5th grade parents that evening to give them an overview of fifth grade and what to expect. It was a great success and we hope there will be less anxiety about the transition next fall.</p>
<p>The 8th grade students attended the CU4Reality Financial Fair on May 29. They were dressed for success as they participated in a real-life simulation of balancing a budget based on a chosen career. In addition, the students will be participating in two transition activities on June 14 and June 17. These Move Up activities will allow students to tour the high school, meet teachers, receive answers to questions, and learn about the clubs and activities available to them over the next four years. These activities are an interactive way to help ease the transition from middle school to high school.</p>
<p>Leaders In Prevention (LIP) has been busy with various activities as well. LIP hosted Leadership Week in March. All students in the school got to participate in various activities related to leadership skills. LIP also went to visit the fourth grade classes and answered questions about middle school. Our final end-of-the-year activities include going to the Challenge Course at the Allard Center to work on team building and leadership skills and hosting the LIP Luau for all students  as an end-of-the-year farewell.</p>
<p><strong>End of the year thoughtsâ€¦</strong><br />
  It is hard to believe that another school year has come and gone. We have thoroughly enjoyed getting to know all of the students in our specials classes and in LIP and through many other guidance activities. We feel very fortunate to be at such a wonderful school with so many outstanding students. We would like to wish our eighth grade students all the best in high school. We are certain that they will do well there and in all of their future endeavors. </p>
<p>We hope that everyone has a wonderful summer vacation. Stay safe and have fun!</p>
