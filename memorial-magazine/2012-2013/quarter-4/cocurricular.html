<h2>BMS Student Council</h2>

<p>
This year&rsquo;s student council school gift is a &nbsp;United States armed forces flag, flag pole, and stand. It was displayed during this year&rsquo;s Memorial Day assembly on Friday, May 24. Anyone who hasn&rsquo;t had a chance to see it can do so in the music room.</p>
<p>The last dance for grade 7 and 8 students was held Friday, May 31, in the cafeteria from 7:00-10:00 pm. The dance had a luau theme and despite the sultry weather students had a fun and festive time! Several students won door prizes and many participated in the limbo, which was won by Michael York! Thank you to everyone who attended for helping to make this a wonderful evening. Our parent and teacher chaperones are tops, and we greatly appreciate their dedication and volunteerism!</p>
<p>As advisors we feel it has been a terrific year for student council! We thank each and every representative and executive board member for their outstanding service! We would also like to extend a big thank you to all BMS students, staff, and families for their hard work this year! &nbsp;From Autumn Fest to the Walk-A-Thon, our school gets involved, and together we continue to make a big difference locally and globally!</p>
<p>Last week was student council campaign week. All candidates posted their two posters and some handed out stickers or buttons. Speeches were read and the student body &nbsp;had the difficult task of voting for just five candidates to represent their grade next year. We would like to thank all candidates for the time and effort they put into this process. The results are below. Congratulations to the winners!</p>
<p>Student Council 2013-14 <br />
  Grade 8: Katie Begley, Haley Fleury, Ben Guertin, Gwen Molind, and Shannon Murray<br />
  Grade 7: Emma Conley, Neeraj Naik, Seamus O&rsquo;Reilly, Libby Parker, and Emma Windsor<br />
  Grade 6: Jonathan Cook, Connor Griffin, Meridith Krause, Jillian Roberts, and Madison Tibbetts<br />
  Grade 5: Rachel Budd, Amelia Coe, Meaghan Danahy, Makayla Muray, and Kristina Pizzi</p>
<p>In closing, thank you again to this year&rsquo;s student council for an outstanding job! Eighth grade representatives and executive board members, know we will miss you, and we wish you only the best at BHS!<br />
  </p>
<p>We wish everyone a terrific summer, and we look forward to seeing and working with you next year!</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
