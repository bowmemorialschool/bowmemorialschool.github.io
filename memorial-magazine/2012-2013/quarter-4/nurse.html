        <p>The warm weather has finally arrived! Summer vacation is just around the corner. Please pick up any medications from the school nurse prior to the end of school on June 18. We cannot safely store medication over the summer. </p>
        <p>While you are enjoying a more relaxed pace and some summer fun, remember it is also a great time to contact your child&rsquo;s doctor and update physical exams, immunizations, emergency action plans, and medication permits for the next school year. Be sure to send a copy of recent health information to the school nurse for your child&rsquo;s file.</p>
        <p><strong>Physical Exams</strong>:<br />
          <u>6th grade</u>: Bow School District Policy requires an updated physical exam (within the last year) prior to entry into 6th grade. Ask for an updated immunization record as well. <br />
          <u>Sports</u>: Children wishing to participate in sports this fall must have a physical exam on file from within 2 years of their first day of practice. This form must be on file PRIOR to the tryouts.</p>
        <p><strong>Immunizations:</strong><br />
          <strong>Tdap: </strong>Generally given at age 11 years, Tdap, <strong> </strong>which contains Pertussis (whooping cough), is a one-time Tetanus booster for adolescents. If your child is 11 years old or will be by the first day of school, he/she is required to have a Tdap immunization on file. </p>
        <p>Note: You can now check the Infinite Campus portal to confirm that your child&rsquo;s immunization records are up to date per NH Immunization requirements for school attendance. </p>
        <p>As summer approaches some precautions to consider: </p>
        <ul type="disc">
          <li>Remind      your children to go feet first into any waters of unknown depth to prevent      head or neck injury. </li>
          <li>Be      diligent about their wearing of helmets for bicycling, skate boarding,      horseback riding,  competitive sports, and any other time when there may be a possibility      of head injury. </li>
        </ul>
        <p>We have had several students with reported concussions this school year. Most all of them were sustained during competitive sports, even some when the child was wearing a helmet. Consider consulting your child&rsquo;s physician about getting a baseline screening such as ImPACTÂ®. This pre-screening is designed to capture a baseline level of brain function <u>before</u> an individual sustains an injury. It is fairly inexpensive and valuable information for treatment should a child get a concussion in the future. </p>
        <p>I am in and out during the summertime, and I try to check e-mail and voicemail periodically. There is typically someone in the main office available to receive paperwork or answer most questions. I will be returning along with the teachers officially on August 26. <strong>HAVE A HEALTHY AND SAFE SUMMER VACATION!</strong> <br />
