      <p>As this year in fifth grade comes to a close, we reflect on how much we have enjoyed getting to know all of your enthusiastic and wonderful children. We would like to say thank you to all parents who have helped to make this a wonderful experience, from helping out at home to volunteering as chaperones. We truly appreciate all of your support.</p>

      <p>FIFTH GRADE STUDENTS READ OVER 620 BOOKS IN A MONTH AND A HALF!  Our Great Stone Face Challenge was once again a great success!  It is amazing to see how their reading ability and fluency has improved after reading so many books. We were all happy to learn that the winning title was <em>Wonder</em>, written by R.J. Palacio. Many fifth graders enjoyed this book also and were glad that it won. It was interesting to discover that most of our votes correlated with fifth graders across New Hampshire. The new <a href="http://chilis.nhlibrarians.org/files/2013/05/GSF-final-tally-2012-20131.pdf">Great Stone Face list</a> was announced in May, and many fifth graders have already started reading books from this new list. We hope that fifth graders will continue to read and enjoy many great books this summer. <br />
                    <br />
        We have also been having a lot of fun learning how to improve dictionary us. It is always fun learning how to use the pronunciation key to write their own names as well as other words. Students have also enjoyed races and other games, which helped to improve their speed for locating words. Fifth graders have grown throughout the year to be amazingly fast and accurate dictionary users.<br />
                    <br />
        In language arts, grade 5 students have been writing up a storm! They selected their own topics and created stories incorporating all of the focus strategies we have learned throughout the year. These included exciting leads, dialogue, figurative language, strong word choices, and descriptive detail to add pizzazz and make their stories come alive! The students diligently revised and edited their stories until they were ready to be proudly displayed at the Education Fair. Afterwards, the children had the opportunity to share their masterpieces with their peers during our Writer&rsquo;s Celebration Days. The stories were truly impressive!<br />
<br />
        Next, the students exchanged pen pal letters with the incoming fourth graders to answer questions and help set the students&rsquo; minds at ease before coming to BMS in the fall.<br />
<br />
        The students then shifted their focus to fine-tune their skills in correctly identifying many parts of speech. After reading several entertaining children&rsquo;s books and practicing in the textbook, they did several fun activities, such as writing color poems, playing adverb charades, being tied up in prepositional phrases, and creating treasure maps with written directions using many prepositional phrases.<br />
<br />
        After completing the government unit in social studies, students moved on to geography where they mastered identifying twenty-seven different locations in North America, including countries, bodies of water, mountain ranges, and several capital cities. In addition, many students identified ten countries and islands in Central America for extra credit. They also continued their weekly geography challenge questions and learned about latitude and longitude and contour maps.</p>
      <p>We continue to stay current with world news by periodically reading <em><a href="http://sni.scholastic.com">Scholastic News Magazine</a></em> and journaling our thoughts.</p>
     <div class="photo photo-left"> <img src="images/fort2.jpg" width="345" height="181"/></div>
     
      <p> Our exciting trip to <a href="http://www.fortat4.org">Fort at No. 4</a> in Charleston, NH on May 31 brought to life the early days of our country and frontier life in the 1700s. The students participated in a variety of activities and met colonists, Indians, and soldiers at this living museum!</p>
      <p>Finally, the students are learning some of the basic principles of economics by being involved in a variety of hands-on activities. For example, they learned about supply and demand through &ldquo;popcorn economics&rdquo; and about the ins and outs of home buying based on specific criteria, complete with trade-offs and opportunity costs. Students will top off the year with a high energy Market Day for which they must team up to create the idea of a new product to market attractively. It is anticipated that fun will be had by all as the students compete with their classmates to see who can make the most transactions with Eskeland/Scupp dollars!</p>
      <p>Grade 5 mathematicians have been hard at work developing their fraction skills!&nbsp; We have explored and practiced greatest common factor and least common multiple, as well as simplifying fractions and changing mixed numbers and improper fractions. We also spent time converting between fractions and decimals and comparing and ordering fractions. Currently, we are adding and subtracting fractions and mixed numbers and will finish out the year with some geometry concepts.</p>
      <p>As the lazy days of summer approach, your child is encouraged to continue to use his/her math skills throughout the summer months. Skills such as multiplication and division and working with fractions and decimals can naturally fit into everyday activities. In addition, it is essential that sixth graders know their multiplication facts!&nbsp; Hopefully, some time can be found (perhaps on a rainy day!) to practice flashcards, and/or visit an online site for practice of facts and other skills. </p>

      <p>In science, students researched the Age of Space Exploration and made timelines beginning with the 1957 launch of <em><a href="http://history.nasa.gov/sputnik/">Sputnik</a></em>, the first manmade satellite. Our 3-D projects showcased some of the most interesting satellites, space probes, rockets, and space stations. The <em>Voyager 2 </em>space probe<em>, </em>launched in 1977, isone of the most remarkable space stories. This mission to the planets was designed to last only a few years. Amazingly, not only has <em><a href="http://voyager.jpl.nasa.gov">Voyager 2</a></em> left our solar system, but it is also expected to continue transmitting data until 2020!  Imagineâ€”an ordinary laptop computer has more power than the computers aboard<em> Voyager 2</em>! </p>
      <p>We made rockets powered by water and antacid tablets, and we hypothesized whose rockets would fly the highest. Some of the results were simply flabbergasting to our young scientists. Why did rockets with short wings and small cones fly higher than those with long wings and big cones? Why were some rockets that leaked their fuel still able to soar while others could not? Science at its best!</p>
      <p>We also researched, designed, and made awesome 3-D projects of known USA rockets, space shuttles, space probes, satellites, and other space objects. </p>

      <p> In learning about the scientific process, we constructed enclosed structures of raw eggs to be dropped from the school roof by a BMS custodian. Whose eggs will survive the crash? Whose hypothesis will be correct? Although our work was based on good science, a few eggs became scrambled before our eyes!</p>
      <p>We also worked in teams to solve problems using the scientific method: asking questions, stating a hypothesis, designing and conducting an experiment, identifying the variables, recording information, analyzing and organizing data, drawing conclusions, and continuing the process of scientific inquiry. It was exciting observing students designing and working together through the scientific process.<br />
        <br />
        Special note: Thank you to the parent chaperones who were able to spend a day with us at the Montshire Science Museum in Norwich, Vermont. You helped to make our visit memorable and fun, too!  <br />
<br />
        It is hard to believe that the year is almost over. It has been an exciting and productive one filled with many accomplishments. We wish everyone an enjoyable summer and hope that your children are looking forward to sixth grade and all they will learn.        </p>
