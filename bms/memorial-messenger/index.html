These changes have been made only to the side parking lot. As always, staff parking will be indicated with white lines and visitor parking will have yellow lines. The twelve spots that are adjacent to the grass that were formally designated as visitor spots have now been switched to staff parking. These twelve spots have been moved to the Bow Center Road side of the center section of the parking lot.</p><p>Drop-Off: If you are planning on any extended conversations with your child at drop-off we ask that you park in one of the new yellow visitor spots. We are hoping that you will have the opportunity to pull through in the spot which should make it easier when you exit. If you are just planning on a quick good-bye we ask that you pull as far forward as possible in the drop-off lane. This will help keep the school traffic off of Bow Center Road.</p><p>Pick-Up: Please use the newly painted yellow visitor spots to wait for the students or pull forward in the drop-off lane.</p><p>Please drive slowly in the parking lot as many students are moving through the parking lot both at arrival and dismissal times.

      <h2>Summer Letter from Mr. Osburn</h2>
    </a>
    <time datetime="">
      August 2, 2013
    </time>
    <p>To the BMS Community,</p><p>With approximately another month of summer to go I have begun thinking actively about the upcoming school year. Doug Totten is joining our community as Assistant Principal, but he is already a part of the Bow community as both a resident and a parent of two young children. He has worked as a middle school teacher with a strong math background, and an administrator at a K-8 school in Freemont, New Hampshire. He brings terrific insights to our community based on the wide range of professional experiences he has had. He will help to lead BMS forward into the future as we continue to grow and evolve as a learning community. BMS will continue to strive to be the best place that we can be for students and the rest of our community. With that in mind I am reissuing the open invitation to come in and speak with either Doug or I.</p><p>BMS as a school is going to be actively working to expand our teaching comfort zone with educational &#8220;best practices.&#8221; I explained to the faculty at the end of the last school year that I wanted each team to adopt a single different &#8220;best practice&#8221; and work with that concept during the first half of the school year. Our goal is to expand and improve the already high level of instruction your children have been receiving at BMS. I am encouraging teachers to explore a variety of different educational approaches that are aligned with a standards based approach to education (the direction the nation is moving). This is an effort to be reflective and grow as a community within our profession in a way that is consistent with what the leading experts in our field have determined are &#8220;best practices.&#8221;</p><p>You will also notice a few changes as you read through the Student / Parent Handbook this year. Both the changes to the grading policy and the discipline guidelines center around the idea of being transparent with what we are trying to communicate with students and parents. Students will notice that majors and minors have been removed from the discipline guidelines found in the handbook. We made this change because we wanted to be clear with students, and everyone else in our community about what we are trying to communicate through a consequence. If a student is to receive a written warning, we will simply call it that rather than a &#8220;minor,&#8221; if they received a detention then that is what we will call it. It is our hope that this small change makes things more clear and transparent for everyone involved.</p><p>Another change you will find this coming year has to do with grading and assessing. The handbook has been changed to reflect an evolution in thinking that is occurring in the area of assessment. If you have had older children enrolled at Bow High School or another public high school you are already aware of the competency movement which has occurred. This has been a very positive step for public education requiring educators to identify what are the key concepts students must understand if they are to be competent or proficient in a given course. This movement towards competencies has implications for grading and assessing as well, our hope is that our grades will more accurately reflect what a student knows and is able to do. To help facilitate this new focus we looked at our own late work policy and have begun to engage in a faculty wide discussion around grading practices and what they communicate.</p><p>At BMS this coming year, you will find the late work policy is different than it has been in the past particularly in our 7th and 8th grades. Historically, if students did not turn in their work on time the penalties were stringent including the use of a zero. We have moderated the penalty substantially for two reasons. The first is simply because we need for the student to turn in their work even if it is late if we are going to be able to assess it and provide academic feedback for them to learn from. Second, I believe the new penalties will not diminish work completion rates, actually it is my belief that the new late work policy will provide a higher level of work completion as students realize it doesn’t go away and the work is a part of the learning process. In the past, once a student has received the zero or the fifty they had no motivation for completing the assignment and feedback loop was closed (as was the opportunity for learning). Now what students will hear is, &#8220;I still need the assignment Adam, there will be a 10% penalty because you don’t have it prepared for today but I really need you to do it if I am going to be able to help you understand photosynthesis.&#8221; In short we as a community want assessments and their grades to reflect a student’s understanding of the curriculum. Work habits are important, but often grades can weight those habits so heavily that they end up causing a grade that misrepresents what a student actually knows and is able to do.</p><p>I am excited for this school year to begin. We as a faculty are striving to be reflective and continue growing to be the best school we can be for our students. As always I invite your feedback and look forward to speaking with you. I hope that the changes you find this year within our school are comfortable, reasonable and consistent with the vision and direction I will continue to lead BMS towards. The theme for all of our efforts moving forward is around clear transparent communication whether it has to do with discipline (no additional codes), grading (where grades communicate and reflect understanding of material) or just our daily conversations. Additionally, we are a reflective group of educators and we are going to pursue and explore &#8220;best practices&#8221; within our profession and apply them as appropriate to better serve our students. These changes do not represent a destination philosophically but rather the beginning of a journey towards a more standards based school. We have a terrific school and these changes will help us to improve in ways that are consistent with the direction of the nation, the state and our district. I will be writing to you again in a few weeks to introduce our new math specialist and share a few thoughts on the upcoming school year. I hope that you enjoy the final few weeks of summer.</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Adam Osburn</p>

    <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p><p>The end of the school year is rapidly approaching, and there is a flurry of activity at BMS as we wrap up the final weeks. How quickly time flies! Memorable events have spanned the year, going all the way back to the first day of school when classes spelled &#8220;BMS&#8221; in the parking lot by forming giant, human letters. Everyone was challenged to get involved and to make a difference. We congratulate students on accepting this challenge and succeeding in a spectacular fashion. Students followed their interests and our school community was better for it. Several new clubs and activities were created, and tremendous successes were achieved in all areas—the arts and athletics, as well as in computer club, math team, and other activities. What a fantastic year!</p><p>Grade 5 is culminating the year with trips to the Montshire Museum and The Fort at No. 4. Grade 6 recently celebrated Greek Day. Grade 7 is working with a blacksmith as part of an artist-in-residence program, and grade 8 is back from a week at Sargent Camp and has a number of exciting culminating activities remaining, including a new Leadership Day led for us by the BHS Senate students. These are just a few of the highlights from Quarter 4. We aim to provide a rich array of experiences for students and to extend learning outside the classroom walls. Please check out the details from each grade level, as well as specials, in this newsletter!</p><p>To all students—from those completing their first year at BMS to those heading off to BHS next year—we again issue the same challenge with which we started the year: GET INVOLVED AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</p><p>Best wishes for a safe and fun-filled summer!</p><p>Best regards,</p><p><a href='mailto:aosburn@bownet.org'>Adam Osburn</a>, Principal<br /> <a href='mailto:draynard@bownet.org'>Dave Raynard</a>, Assistant Principal</p><p>PS &#8212; Read a book!</p>

    <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe we are already approaching the end of the 1st quarter! We certainly recognize how quickly time goes by and how much has happened since the start of the 2012-2013 school year.</p><p>Students kicked off the year with a school-wide assembly and activity, emphasizing key themes promoting a sense of community and a shared responsibility for having a great year. Students have taken the shared responsibility theme to heart, driving the creation of several new clubs, including cross country, volleyball, geography, scrapbooking, and more! Our Back-to-School nights were well attended and provided an opportunity for parents to meet teachers and administrators, follow their children&#8217;s schedules, and explore BMS. It was a pleasure to see so many of you join us!</p><p>Fostering our sense of community includes communication between and among the school, students, and families. Over the summer, &#8220;open house&#8221; sessions were held to give parents an opportunity to meet with us and discuss any topics of interest. An electronic survey was also sent via our Infinite Campus Messenger. All the feedback was greatly appreciated! We continue to use the IC Messenger to send out weekly updates, including information about school and district events, sports schedules and scores, grade-level announcements, and related news from administration. If you have any questions about receiving this info, please call us. You can also use <a href='https://campus.bownet.org/campus/portal/bow.jsp'>Infinite Campus</a> to check grades and assignments. This online portal is a tool we are still refining as we seek to promote more open communication. You can also find detailed information at the BMS website, including grade-level and teacher pages. You should always feel welcome to call us directly with any questions, concerns, or ideas!</p><p>It has been a busy, productive 1st quarter. Fifth grade students have settled in and are active participants in our community. We welcomed Ashley Sevigny to the 7th grade team. The entire school has practiced fire, lock down, and assembly evacuation drills. The statewide NECAP testing took place through much of October. This test helps assess students and enables BMS to more effectively design curricula in order to promote individual student achievement. Faculty members have started the process of aligning curricula to the Common Core State Standards. Red Ribbon Week took place during the week of October 22-25. This is a program focused on alcohol and drug prevention. The week culminated with our Autumn Fest Assembly, celebrating the participation of students across the BMS community. During the assembly, the Bow Reads program was also recognized for its amazing success over the summer. What a great 1st quarter!</p><p>The falling of leaves signals the arrival of our next season, and we look forward to all the successes that await BMS in quarter 2—as well as quarters 3 and 4!</p><p>Coming soon are our parent conferences, taking place on Thursday, Nov. 8 and Friday, Nov. 9 (please call the main office to schedule a conference).</p><p>As always, please feel free to contact us at any point with any questions, concerns, or ideas!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Adam Osburn, Principal Dave Raynard, Assistant Principal</p>
