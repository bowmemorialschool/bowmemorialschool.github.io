    <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p><p>It&#8217;s hard to believe we are already approaching the end of the 1st quarter! We certainly recognize how quickly time goes by and how much has happened since the start of the 2012-2013 school year.</p><p>Students kicked off the year with a school-wide assembly and activity, emphasizing key themes promoting a sense of community and a shared responsibility for having a great year. Students have taken the shared responsibility theme to heart, driving the creation of several new clubs, including cross country, volleyball, geography, scrapbooking, and more! Our Back-to-School nights were well attended and provided an opportunity for parents to meet teachers and administrators, follow their children&#8217;s schedules, and explore BMS. It was a pleasure to see so many of you join us!</p><p>Fostering our sense of community includes communication between and among the school, students, and families. Over the summer, &#8220;open house&#8221; sessions were held to give parents an opportunity to meet with us and discuss any topics of interest. An electronic survey was also sent via our Infinite Campus Messenger. All the feedback was greatly appreciated! We continue to use the IC Messenger to send out weekly updates, including information about school and district events, sports schedules and scores, grade-level announcements, and related news from administration. If you have any questions about receiving this info, please call us. You can also use <a href='https://campus.bownet.org/campus/portal/bow.jsp'>Infinite Campus</a> to check grades and assignments. This online portal is a tool we are still refining as we seek to promote more open communication. You can also find detailed information at the BMS website, including grade-level and teacher pages. You should always feel welcome to call us directly with any questions, concerns, or ideas!</p><p>It has been a busy, productive 1st quarter. Fifth grade students have settled in and are active participants in our community. We welcomed Ashley Sevigny to the 7th grade team. The entire school has practiced fire, lock down, and assembly evacuation drills. The statewide NECAP testing took place through much of October. This test helps assess students and enables BMS to more effectively design curricula in order to promote individual student achievement. Faculty members have started the process of aligning curricula to the Common Core State Standards. Red Ribbon Week took place during the week of October 22-25. This is a program focused on alcohol and drug prevention. The week culminated with our Autumn Fest Assembly, celebrating the participation of students across the BMS community. During the assembly, the Bow Reads program was also recognized for its amazing success over the summer. What a great 1st quarter!</p><p>The falling of leaves signals the arrival of our next season, and we look forward to all the successes that await BMS in quarter 2â€”as well as quarters 3 and 4!</p><p>Coming soon are our parent conferences, taking place on Thursday, Nov. 8 and Friday, Nov. 9 (please call the main office to schedule a conference).</p><p>As always, please feel free to contact us at any point with any questions, concerns, or ideas!</p><p>Sincerely,</p><p>Adam Osburn, Principal Dave Raynard, Assistant Principal</p>
