    <p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>

<p>The end of the school year is rapidly approaching, and there is a flurry of activity at BMS as we wrap up the final weeks. How quickly time flies! Memorable events have spanned the year, going all the way back to the first day of school when classes spelled &#8220;BMS&#8221; in the parking lot by forming giant, human letters. Everyone was challenged to get involved and to make a difference. We congratulate students on accepting this challenge and succeeding in a spectacular fashion. Students followed their interests and our school community was better for it. Several new clubs and activities were created, and tremendous successes were achieved in all areas—the arts and athletics, as well as in computer club, math team, and other activities. What a fantastic year!</p>

<p>Grade 5 is culminating the year with trips to the Montshire Museum and The Fort at No. 4. Grade 6 recently celebrated Greek Day. Grade 7 is working with a blacksmith as part of an artist-in-residence program, and grade 8 is back from a week at Sargent Camp and has a number of exciting culminating activities remaining, including a new Leadership Day led for us by the BHS Senate students. These are just a few of the highlights from Quarter 4. We aim to provide a rich array of experiences for students and to extend learning outside the classroom walls. Please check out the details from each grade level, as well as specials, in this newsletter!</p>

<p>To all students—from those completing their first year at BMS to those heading off to BHS next year—we again issue the same challenge with which we started the year: GET INVOLVED AND MAKE A DIFFERENCE!</p>

<p>Best wishes for a safe and fun-filled summer!</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

<p>PS &#8212; Read a book!</p>
