<p class="library">Bow Memorial School readers have been busy at work spending a great deal of time &ldquo;getting caught reading&rdquo; during the month of May. This year, BMS recognized May as Get Caught Reading Month in several big ways.</p>
<p class="library">We began the month with a special school-wide D.E.A.R. (Drop Everything and Read) session during a designated fifteen minute block on an assigned school day. As the month continued, several adult &ldquo;spotters&rdquo; traveled the school building looking for students who were reading at the most unexpected times and/or in the most unusual places. The readers had fun selecting from gift bags filled with school-related items and one-of-a-kind prizes.</p>
<p class="library">May concluded with a two-day BOOK EXCHANGE during which 173 books changed hands. It was a great way for students to add new titles to their home libraries without spending a penny.  What a nice way to swap gently used books and to keep reading!</p>
<div class="photo photo-right"> <img src="images/booksforpatients.jpg" width="305" height="165"/></div> 

<p>BMS concluded its READ ACROSS AMERICA &ldquo;Books for Beginners&rdquo; Community Literacy Initiative with Concord Hospital Family Health Center. This, again, was an opportunity for Bow Memorial students to share their love of reading by bringing new books for beginning readers to the BMS Library from early March through the beginning of May. Through new book donations from BMS students and their families, children who visit their doctors at the Family Health Center at Concord Hospital are &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; with new beginning reading books (K-2) and picture books. Students who participated in this community literacy initiative were rewarded  with BMS School Store certificates to be used during a special &ldquo;Thank You Reception.&rdquo; A Concord Hospital representative visited to explain how these donated books will be shared with others.  </p>
<p>Students have also been involved in designing special bookmarks that promote reading fun and advertise the benefits of reading. These bookmark creations will be &ldquo;gifted&rdquo; to the Concord Hospital Family Health Center along with our &ldquo;Books for Beginners&rdquo; book collection. </p>
<p>During the summer months, Bow Memorial students will again be involved in our SUNSATIONAL SUMMER READING program.  This is an opportunity to let the BMS reading teachers know what great books are being read during June, July, and August. Students may pick up Sunsational Summer Reading yellow cards in their reading classrooms, at the BMS main office, and at the Baker Free Library. They should bring completed cards back to these locations where huge boxes are provided. When school begins in the fall, students who have participated in this summer reading initiative could be big prize winners. Your yellow card may be chosen, at random, BUT YOU MUST READ THIS SUMMER TO WIN!</p>

<p>Many good things end the school year (besides field trips and summer vacation plans) all in the name of reading. One was the Story Laboratory Book Fair which was a smashing success! Five percent more books were purchased than at the previous two spring fairs. Many thanks to all of you for supporting literacy and nurturing your children's love for reading. </p>

<p>Other reading excitement includes the <a href="http://chilis.nhlibrarians.org/gsf/">Great Stone Face</a> award announcements of the winning title for this year as well as the list of new nominee books, which the fifth and sixth grade will begin reading for next year&rsquo;s voting. The 2013 winner for the Great Stone Face award is the book by R.J. Palacio, <em>Wonder</em>. It is a big favorite of our students as well. This story about a boy named Auggie who&rsquo;s had a difficult life and transitions from being home-schooled to attending public school. It is so much more than just a story about middle schoolers. The parents aren&rsquo;t  even missing or dead! It is one of those stories not to be missed. It will make you cry and laugh, while you turn the pages to the end. <a href="http://chilis.nhlibrarians.org">The Children&rsquo;s Librarians of NH</a> do a great job of selecting these books for grades fourth through sixth. <a href="http://chilis.nhlibrarians.org/files/2013/05/GSF-brochure-2013-14.pdf">Click here</a> for this year&rsquo;s selection. These titles will  make for some great summer reading. Don&rsquo;t forget the <a href="http://nhlibrarians.org/tag/isinglass-award/">Isinglass</a> nominee books which make summer page-turners for seventh through eighth grade. </p>
<p>Many thanks to all of the parent and student volunteers who made sure that the library was dusted, the books shelved, and the various projects completed. The library wouldn&rsquo;t have been the same without the dedicated assistance from our wonderful parent volunteers, Mrs. Mary Haley and Mrs. GerryAnn Dubois. They somehow managed to volunteer in the library, go to work, and give their time to various other school activities. They are much appreciated! The student Library Club members assisted quite faithfully throughout the year and earned an end-of-year party! We love their enthusiasm and dedication to meet every Friday before school! The club members are:</p>

  <p>A thank you doesn&rsquo;t cover our gratitude for the time, dedication, hard work, and loyalty that Mrs. Ford has brought to BMS as library assistant for these past seven years. She knows most of the students well and can recommend a good book, repair a broken one, fix a printer problem, and be sure your books are in. She&rsquo;s taught a few classes and assisted with at least fourteen book fairs, author visits, and created many wonderful library displays. Can you tell she loves reading and working in our middle school?   We wish her the very best as she moves over to the high school  to fill the position as the assistant librarian, once held by Lucy Mottola who will be retiring. We will miss you, Mrs. Ford!</p>
  <p><strong><em>So you want a good book?</em></strong> Sorry, it&rsquo;s LOST!  This is the scenario I hope to avoid as we end the year. All students with overdue books have received library notices requesting their books be returned as soon as possible. We still have approximately 200 books checked out to 94 students. Please ask your child to return them or to talk to Mrs. Rousseau-Evans about what may have happened. Oftentimes, instead of paying to replace the book, a cheaper option is to purchase a replacement copy. Let&rsquo;s face it; losing library books is bound to happen, but if they can be replaced, it&rsquo;s okay.</p>
  <p>Have an enjoyable summer.</p>
