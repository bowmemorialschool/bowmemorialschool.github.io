        <p><strong>A Personal Reflection</strong></p>
        <p>Friday, March 12, 2010. As I sat holding eleven-day-old baby Brody at the Annual School District Meeting, I listened as school officials and taxpayers discussed the idea of adding an additional teacher for the incoming fifth grade class. Due to a small incoming 8th grade class, it was determined that an 8th grade teacher would be the one to move down to the 5th grade and stay with the class, if the plan were to go through. I looked at my husband and said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s going to be me; I just know it.&rdquo;</p>
        <p>Three years later, with the days dwindling away, I can&rsquo;t believe how much I&rsquo;ve seen, learned, and changed from that moment. Teachers usually have a year to get to know students, work with them, laugh with them, discipline them, and then send the students on their way. Our situation has been entirely different...entirely!<br />
          </p>
        <p>As you began 5th grade those very first days, you cried when you didn&rsquo;t know where the office was. You didn&rsquo;t know if you could remember where the bathroom was, and the idea of punching in your lunch code (let alone remember it after the fact) was monumental!  You interrupted class to announce you had lost a tooth, and you spent study telling me about EVERY SINGLE FACT that you learned about &ldquo;parts&rdquo; in health class. You signed up for special movies and had endless projects in science class and adjusted to BMS life, sans playground.</p>
        <p>In 6th grade, with a little experience behind you, you became savvy middle schoolers. Brody was now two and his big sister Mallory was four. Some of you joined field hockey in the fall and the track team in the spring, while others continued with outside sports such as soccer, basketball, hockey, gymnastics, dance, baseball, softball, and lacrosse. The field trip to Boston to the Museum of Fine Arts, Pi Day, rockets, Greek Day, and Roman research papers kept you busy academically. No longer were you afraid to walk down to the nurse&rsquo;s office by yourself, and you could keep track of our crazy schedule far better than I could!</p>
        <p>Seventh grade. There were trips to the Capitol Center, Jan Terry, the blacksmith, and the rescheduled Canobie Lake field trip. You went to your first school dance and were playing on school teams, working at the school store, watching a magician deliver a poignant message, and understanding with tears in your eyes, the message behind the Memorial Day Movie <em>Taking Chance</em>.</p>
        <p>How very lucky I feel to have been there and to have experienced it all with you. I have watched you grow, not only physically, but academically and emotionally. Friends have moved in to Bow and some have left us. Some of us have lost family members and family pets, and others have broken bones. Appendixes have been removed, big games have been won and lost, detentions have been served, and grades have had their ups and downs.</p>
        <p>Brody is now three and Mallory will soon be six. You have heard their funny kid stories, have played with them at school events, have offered advice about disciplining them, and shared stories about yourself as young children.</p>
        <p>I have been able to watch your games, your concerts, your birthdays, your good days and bad. For me, the class of 2018 is not just another class. The past three years has been an experience that has changed me and my understanding of kids in ways that I could never explain. I can honestly say that as a group, you have taught me more about teaching than I probably have taught you about academics.</p>
        <p>It goes without saying that I am glad to still have a connection with you as 8th graders. Although I will only have one section of 8th grade language arts, I look forward to experiencing your last year of middle school with you.</p>
        <p>To the Class of 2018, you have become more than my students; you are family.</p>
        <p>Have a restful, fun, and safe summer. The best is yet to come.</p>
        <p>Always,<br />
          Mrs. Hinck        </p>
