  <p>In math classes, the majority of the final quarter has been spent on geometry, probability, and statistics. Students created geometric designs (line compass, fractal, and reflection) and discovered the sum of interior angles of various polygons. They classified polygons and calculated perimeter, area, surface area, and volume. The probability unit focused on simple and compound events, tree diagrams, and the Fundamental Counting Principle. Our year is wrapping up with an overview of graphing, including measures of central tendency and different types of graphs, and an Excel graphing project. In addition to the above units, Course 3 students also completed work with permutations, combinations, proportions, and similar polygons.<br />
    If you missed the deadline to order a <em>Summer Skills Sharpener</em> math book and would like to order one, <a href="http://www.summerskills.com/summerskillsbooks/math_books">click here</a>. You can look at samples, order, pay, and have the book(s) delivered right to your home.</p>

  <p>Reading classes recently finished our study of Greek mythology. We had a great time! The students learned about the Greek gods and goddesses as well as many of the famous heros from this ancient literature. Probably the hardest thing we did was to listen to <em>Black Ships Before Troy</em> by Rosemary Sutcliff. We had many characters to keep track of on both the Greek and Trojan sides, as well as any number of gods and goddesses who are part of this story. In spite of how difficult this epic tale is, the students did an incredible job piecing it all together. We also read the story of Heracles, Perseus, Theseus, and Jason, famous heros of Greek mythology. Students selected from a variety of choices to prepare for our first ever, and hopefully annual, Mythology Fair. They created posters, wrote quests or comparison papers or books, and found pictures and facts about their area of study and then presented them on May 17 to parents, students, and teachers. Great job! If you were not able to attend the Mythology Fair, you can see the posters hanging  in the BMS halls. To end the year, we will listen to <em>The Odyssey</em> as told by the famous storyteller Odds Bodkins. In addition, we are working on our last unit of the year, a nonfiction research unit about each student's special area of interest.</p>

  <p>Science classes have spent the majority of the final quarter learning about electricity and magnetism. Students completed an electricity project in time for the Education Fair. Students conducted experiments measuring the effect of voltage on the strength of their homemade electromagnets. Finally, students will conclude the year with explorations of Newton&rsquo;s laws of motion. They will design, construct, and test water bottle rockets propelled by compressed air. Students will design their rockets to achieve one of three possible goals: greatest time aloft, greatest height achieved, or greatest accuracy. </p>
  <p>In social studies classes, students studied ancient Greece, with Greek Day as the culminating activity. A special thank you goes to all the wonderful parents who made Greek Day possible. Also during this quarter, the sixth graders visited the World&rsquo;s Fair at Bow High School and took a trip to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston. They shared the information they learned through the Egypt research projects with fellow classmates. The Roman Empire is the current topic of study. By the end of this school year, each class will create and film a movie presenting the information acquired about the Romans. What a great way to wrap up!</p>
  <p>Thank you to all parents of language arts students who responded to their child&rsquo;s request written in his/her persuasive letter. The essays were very well written, and the students were very convincing. We are now moving on to a mystery unit. Students will be turning into super sleuths as they learn the elements found in the genre and work to solve various mysteries. We will end the year with having students writing and sharing their own mysteries. It is a delightful unit and a fun way to end the year. It has been a pleasure writing and working with your child. </p>
