<p>
When should support be put into place for students facing academic challenges? </p>
<p>Preventative measures should always be the first strategy in minimizing and possibly eliminating the need for interventions later. If and when a student does struggle, it is important to recognize the problem(s) immediately and to employ effective interventions to get the student back on track as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Although there is always some overlap, prevention and intervention strategies generally can be categorized into two types, cognitive preventions and interventions and non-cognitive.  </p>
<p>Cognitive preventions are those that directly assist a student in the acquisition of academic learning. These typically include curriculum, instruction by qualified teachers, standards-aligned instructional materials, aligned assessment, intervention instructional materials, additional class periods, study skills classes, and standards-based career and technical classes. Results from cognitive prevention and intervention are more easily measured and are directly correlated with student achievement.  Implementing this type of early intervention has proven to be highly effective for life-long learning opportunities.</p>
<p>There are also non-cognitive preventions and interventions that are less direct but nonetheless important as supports for student academic achievement. Without physical, emotional, social, and intellectual support, most adolescents, and particularly higher-risk adolescents, will not make the gains educators expect. These interventions are more difficult to correlate with test scores; usually, other indicators of success are used, such as attendance rates, dropout data, discipline and expulsion data, and counseling referrals. </p>
<p>Non-cognitive interventions include a range of programs and strategies that keep students healthy, safe, and engaged in learning: youth development, character education, attendance and dropout prevention programs, nutrition, anti-bullying, service-learning, before-and-after-school programs, and interest-based electives, including visual and performing arts, physical education, and advisories.  </p>
<p>Prior to needing academic interventions, students may benefit from positive support. Creating a college-going culture at middle school and at high school, as well as at home, provides both cognitive and non-cognitive support to adolescents and their families as they strive for higher education.</p>
<p>If teachers and parents have concerns about their student's or child&rsquo;s learning, it is always best to seek advice and pursue the resources available to them as early as possible. Our school and community have so much to offer in Bow. We are fortunate. Certainly, we have the ability to reach each and every one of our students.
