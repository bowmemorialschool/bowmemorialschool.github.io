<p>The eighth grade is thankful to end eight days of NECAP (New England Common Assessment Program) testing, just in time for the end of the quarter. Grades will close the second of November, and report cards will go home November 8.</p>

<p>Also, November will bring the parent-teacher conference days on November 8 and 9. Please contact the BMS office if you would like to schedule on one of these two days.</p>

<p>The team is happy to report that the students sold a lot of candles in support of our annual trip to Sargent Center in May. Please look for more notices soon regarding this trip.</p>

<p>Currently, language arts classes are reading and responding to an excerpt from &#8220;E-Mail From Bill Gates,&#8221; an article by John Seabrook in <em>The New Yorker</em> a few years back. Students were assigned to groups to perform such tasks as e-mailing Bill Gates, researching his early and recent years, and noting past and current technologies inspired and influenced by him. Groups are presenting to the class, and they are particularly excited to share the e-mail replies from Mr. Gates&#8217;s response team. Granted they were disappointed not to hear directly from him, but they understand he is busy. At this time, he is in Africa with Bono working to improve conditions there.</p>

<p>Mrs. George reports that the students successfully completed their cinnamon vs. mold labs. Students found out that cinnamon does slow down the molding process. Now, students are collecting data from their self-designed brine shrimp experiments. The study of chemistry is up next.</p>
