<p>Welcome to 5 Alive!</p>
<div class='photo photo-right'>
  <img src='../newsletter/images/xcc.jpg' />
</div>
<p>It seems like only a short time ago that we observed 104 enthusiastic, anxious, wide-eyed, fifth graders enter into our classrooms. In the process of: meeting new teachers; locating old friends and finding new ones; changing classes; accurately recording daily assignments in agenda books; completing tasks by due dates; using study time productively; participating in band, chorus and other clubs; understanding new school rules; making healthy lunch choices; and participating in NECAP testing, your children have now seemed to settle into a more contented, familiar routine.</p>

<p>We welcome our newest students (and families, too) to 5Alive from other districts in NH and beyond: Osyris, Jade, Liam, Julia, Sophie, Bobby, Adrian, Vose, Austin, Madison, Maile, and Devin. You make our team even better!</p>

<p>Who would have guessed there are so many talented artists in fifth grade? Students in language arts have been shown their enthusiasm for writing by personalizing their writer&#8217;s notebooks with beautiful water color paintings, brainstorming writing ideas, and setting up their writing binders with many helpful reference sheets to prepare the way for becoming accomplished writers. They have created colorful <a href='http://www.wordle.net'>Wordle</a> covers and fascinating poems describing themselves as writers.</p>

<h2 id='language_arts'>Language Arts</h2>
<div class='photo photo-right'>
  <img src='../newsletter/images/spellinglist.jpg' />
</div>
<p>At the beginning of the year, students completed an initial grade 5 prompt to establish a base line for their writing. Most have mastered the grade 5 list of &#8220;No Excuse&#8221; spelling words. Students who proved they already knew these words tackled the challenge of creating a &#8220;No Excuse&#8221; song, rap, poem, or play to present to the class. As you can imagine, this was highly entertaining to all involved! Kudos to these students for such creativity and bravery!</p>

<p>All diligently worked to become proficient in writing solid paragraphs and reports in preparation for the NECAP test. We are looking forward to writing and sharing many entertaining stories throughout the year.</p>

<h2 id='math'>Math</h2>

<p>Grade 5 mathematicians have been hard at work since the start of school! We spent the first few weeks reviewing whole numbers skills, including forms of numbers (standard, expanded, and word), rounding, estimating, adding/subtracting greater whole numbers, and input/output (function) machines. We have since moved on to honing our multiplication skills! Students have been practicing their basic multiplication facts with the goal of increasing accuracy and automaticity. They have enjoyed a variety of fact games and practice strategies. During our multiplication unit, classes will be introduced to and will practice the traditional multiplication algorithm. We will also investigate addition and multiplication properties (commutative, associative, identity, and distributive), mental math patterns, estimating products, and multiplying multi-digit factors.</p>
<div class='photo photo-left'>
  <img height='62' src='../newsletter/images/pizza.jpg' width='127' />
</div>
<p>Following our work with multiplication, we will work to develop our division skills. Students will be excited because division sure comes in handy when we need to figure out how to equally share cookies, cake, pizza, and pie! Our discussion of division will include patterns of divisibility for 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, and 10. These patterns are used to help mathematicians mentally determine whether a remainder will occur before dividing. We will also spend time developing mental math patterns related to basic facts, as well as estimating quotients. We will divide by one and two-digit divisors and multi-digit dividends. Students will also learn how to address remainders through the assessment of the contextual noun. Specifically, they will identify when a remainder can be &#8220;fair shared&#8221; or written as a fraction (cookies, pizza, pie) and when it cannot (people, animals, vehicles).</p>

<p>It is critical that students have a strong working knowledge of their basic multiplication/division facts. Please encourage them to practice the facts often so they know them with speed and accuracy. Also, grade 5 mathematicians are assigned a weekly cumulative review assignment, the 10Qs, that is given and collected on Fridays. Please encourage your student to review this assignment prior to submission.</p>

<h2 id='reading'>Reading</h2>

<p>&#8220;Go for the Gold!&#8221; A wonderful variety of books have been read by grade 5 students in reading class and at home. Many students earned prizes from the mini treasure chest for reading more than one book during the month of September. We will continue to keep the treasure chest open for the next few months. Keep reading!</p>

<p>In September, we rushed to the library for a fun &#8220;scavenger hunt&#8221; tour and learned how to use the exciting, new library computer card catalog. Students practiced using the computer to locate nonfiction books on topics of interest. Using these books, they learned about nonfiction conventions and how they are useful. Finally, they used their knowledge to create colorful, informative posters containing awesome pictures, glossaries, and text boxes! Posters were shared, and we all benefited by learning some interesting facts about a wide variety of interesting topics. Students have also learned comprehension strategies for reading and understanding nonfiction.</p>

<p>&#8220;Exciting : book : : soft : pillow.&#8221; All fifth graders have also been learning about different types of analogies and how they work. They have been playing with words in many different ways from solving word puzzles to completing <em>Wordly Wise</em> lessons. Students&#8217; vocabulary will be growing by leaps and bounds.</p>

<h2 id='science'>Science</h2>
<div class='photo photo-right'>
  <img height='221' src='../newsletter/images/baggie.jpg' width='142' />
</div>
<p>Your young scientists are becoming familiar with the 3 branches of science: life, physical, and earth &#38; space. It&#8217;s amazing how creative students can be in finding six objects, which not only represent the three branches, but will also all squeeze into a quart-sized bag. Can you think of a single object that belongs in all 3 branches of science?</p>

<p>The students &#8220;pictured&#8221; who a scientist is in today&#8217;s world. Using class data, they created pie graphs depicting the genders, ages, education levels, and lifestyles of their chosen scientists. The majority of students painted this sketch of the modern scientist: male, 20-29 years old, with a post-graduate degree, and single!</p>

<p>Students also spent time in the library researching real scientists, including the usual favorites <a href='http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1921/einstein-bio.html'>Albert Einstein</a>, <a href='http://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/1903/marie-curie-bio.html'>Marie Curie</a>, and <a href='http://www.billnye.com'>Bill Nye</a>. Your children were also interested in learning about contemporary scientists such as <a href='http://pbskids.org/dragonflytv/scientists/scientist15.html'>David Ortiz</a>, <a href='http://pbskids.org/dragonflytv/scientists/scientist45.html'>Ryan Newman</a>, <a href='http://www.nsf.gov/staff/staff_bio.jsp?lan=sortega&amp;amp;org=OPP'>Sonia Ortega</a>, <a href='http://pbskids.org/dragonflytv/scientists/scientist36.html'>Dr. Ben Ho</a>, and <a href='http://pbskids.org/dragonflytv/scientists/scientist53.html'>Manuelo Veloso</a>.</p>

<p>In the course of completing their research of scientists and the three branches of science, students developed and practiced their computer skills. They learned how to use the Internet to find useful resources, and they saved work to their BMS folders, created and edited Word documents, and copied/pasted saved images to those documents.</p>

<p>In preparing for our study of weather and hurricanes, we learned about the different layers of Earth&#8217;s atmosphere. Weather and hurricanes occur in the first 10 miles (16 km) above Earth in the <em>troposphere</em>. Ozone is present in the <em>stratosphere</em>, which extends to about 30 miles (50 km). The coldest temperatures can be found in the <em>mesosphere</em>, up to an altitude of about 53 miles (85 km). There, temperatures are as low as -900&#176;C (-1300&#176;F) &#8212; perfect for meteoroids to burn and explode. From your backyard in Bow, you might catch the International Space Station traversing the evening sky within the <em>thermosphere</em>, 370 miles (600 km) above Earth&#8217;s surface. Near the top of the atmosphere, in the <em>exosphere</em>, lies the beginning of true space at an altitude of about 6,000 miles (10,000 km). Far out!</p>

<p>The class is rapidly becoming hurricane experts. If you are contemplating a vacation in the near future somewhere in the Atlantic, eastern Pacific, Caribbean Sea, or the Gulf of Mexico, first consult with your children. They will be able to provide up-to-date information on the nearest storm, its location, wind speed, and classification. You may want to rethink your trip.</p>

<h2 id='social_studies'>Social Studies</h2>

<p>In social studies, students have been involved in a wide variety of activities, such as learning the history of Labor Day through acting out a play, celebrating Constitution Day, and delving into what it means to be good citizens by discussing, memorizing, and reciting the Grade 5 Good Citizenship Pledge. We completed an overview of the course to clarify our focus, decorated our journals, and kept abreast of current events by reading weekly issues of <a href='http://classroommagazines.scholastic.com/category/title/scholastic-news'>Scholastic News</a> magazine.</p>
<div class='photo photo-right'>
  <img height='108' src='../newsletter/images/election.jpg' width='265' />
</div>
<p>Keeping current on the presidential campaigns has been educational and fun as students read <a href='http://magazines.scholastic.com/election-2012'>Scholastic Election 2012</a> magazine and discuss everything from key issues, candidates, history of the election process, to how our government is run.</p>

<p>Geography has taken center stage with our weekly Geography Challenge. Students are researching weekly geography questions related to the United States and world geography, and they are earning social studies-related prizes along the way. Their geography vocabulary is growing along with their appetites to learn more about their world!</p>
