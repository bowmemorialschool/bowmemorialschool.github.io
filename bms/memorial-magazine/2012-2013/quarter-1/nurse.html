<p>It has been an exciting start to the school year. With many new students, a new fifth grade, and a new popular sports club, cross country, the health office has been busy reviewing health records, including physical exams and immunizations.</p>

<p>NOTE: If you check your child&#8217;s immunization records in the <a href='https://campus.bownet.org/campus/portal/bow.jsp'>portal</a>, please know that we are still entering data received this fall. Also, a computer program glitch exists in the Polio and Hepatitis B compliance readings, so it may read as <em>non-compliant</em> even if your child is compliant. We are working on this problem. <strong>For accuracy, you should consult your doctor's office to be sure your child's immunizations are up-to-date.</strong> Feel free to call if you have any questions.</p>

<p>Bow School staff have again participated in a flu immunization clinic. We have also run one session of CPR/AED/First Aid training/re-training for staff. Coaches and advisors of after-school activities are CPR/First Aid certified.</p>

<p>All students are invited to join a new active <strong>Wake-up Club</strong> (previously Walking Club). The group meets on Tuesdays at 8 a.m. in the gym. We will be doing a variety of activities, including &#8220;Open Gym,&#8221; to get our bodies moving in the morning. Students should see Mrs. Ireland for information and an early bus pass.</p>

<p>The Bow School District Wellness Committee has worked on a new Wellness Policy that will be brought back to the school board for review in November. The cafeteria has made changes in the lunch program to offer healthier food choices.</p>

<p>We are also working on a Concussion Policy for the district as required by law. This is an important topic that affects too many children, and research suggests that we need to be resting the brain, not just physically, but cognitively, having children refrain from activities when they are injured.</p>

<p>Once again this year, school nurses are reporting Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) to the NH Communicable Disease Program. Please help us by reporting your child&#8217;s temperature and symptoms when you call to excuse him/her for illness. Thank you for your help.</p>
