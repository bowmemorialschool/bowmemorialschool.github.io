  <h2 id="mr-adam-osburn-principal">Mr. Adam Osburn, Principal</h2>

<p><img src="/bms/assets/adam-osburn.jpg" class="admin-headshot" /></p>

<p>Mr. Osburn began serving as principal of Bow Memorial School in 2012. Before coming to Bow, he served for six years as an assistant principal at Concord High School. Prior to that he worked at Goffstown High School as both a teacher and an administrator for six years. He loves working with middle school children, the same age group with which he began his teaching career in Henniker as a social studies teacher in January of 1995.</p>

<p>Mr. Osburn attended Saint Lawrence University where he earned a Bachelor’s degree in history and received his teacher’s certification. Since then, he has gone to graduate school twice. The first time he attended Notre Dame College in Manchester where he earned a Master’s degree in Curriculum and Instruction. Mr. Osburn then went to Plymouth State University where he obtained a Certificate of Advanced Graduate Study in Educational Leadership.</p>

<p>Mr. Osburn is married with two school-aged children and a yellow Labrador retriever. He enjoys a variety of different physical activities including running, biking, hiking, and skiing. He looks to involve his family in these activities as much as possible (often enticing them to join him with promises of ice cream!).</p>

<p><img src="/bms/assets/doug-totten.jpg" class="admin-headshot" /></p>

<p>Mr. Totten is very excited to live and work in the Bow community. He spent the last two years as the assistant principal at a pre-K through eighth grade school in Fremont. His teaching career includes six years at Rochester Middle School and one year at Sanborn Regional Middle School.

<p>Previous to that he was proud of his work with adolescents in both residential placements and through activity programs at resorts. Mr. Totten’s educational background includes a Bachelor’s degree from Bentley University and a Master’s degree in Educational Leadership from Plymouth State University.</p>

<p>Mr. Totten and his wife have two young children, a chocolate lab named Colo (short for Colorado), and a cat named Red (short for the current American League leading Red Sox). Mr. Totten and his family enjoy spending time at the beach, hiking, biking, skiing, playing in the yard, and reading.</p>
